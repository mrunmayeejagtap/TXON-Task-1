Task 1 â€“ Black and white Image colorization.
Image Colorization is the process of taking an input black and white image and then producing an image output colorized image.
In this approach, we will use deep learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network, to add color to black and white images. The results are so realistic that they can deceive even human observers!
